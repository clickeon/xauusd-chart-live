# XAUUSD Chart Live - Project Planning

## Project Overview
XAUUSD Chart Live is a professional gold price tracking web application that provides real-time market data, interactive price charts, trading signals, and market news. The platform serves traders, investors, and financial analysts interested in gold markets by offering comprehensive tools for gold price analysis and trading decision support.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Recharts for data visualization
  - React Helmet for SEO optimization
  - Axios for API requests
  
- **Backend**:
  - Python Flask API
  - Multiple gold price data sources with fallback mechanisms
  
- **Deployment**:
  - Netlify for frontend hosting
  - Docker support for containerization
  - Environment configuration for development/production

## Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture:

1. **Frontend Layer**: React application that handles UI rendering and user interactions
   - Component-based architecture for modularity
   - Responsive design for all device sizes
   - SEO optimization with meta tags and semantic HTML

2. **API Layer**: Flask backend that provides endpoints for:
   - Current gold prices
   - Historical price data
   - Trading signals
   - Market news
   - Market statistics

3. **Data Source Layer**: Multiple API integrations with fallback mechanisms:
   - Primary data sources (Alpha Vantage, FCS API)
   - Fallback data generators for reliability
   - Error handling and retry logic

## Modules

### Frontend Modules
1. **Core Components**:
   - Navbar: Site navigation
   - HeroSection: Current gold price display
   - PriceChart: Interactive price visualization
   - SignalIndicator: Trading signal generation
   - NewsSection: Market news aggregation
   - Footer: Site information and links

2. **API Integration**:
   - goldApi.js: Centralized API client for all gold data
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

3. **UI Components**:
   - Reusable UI elements (buttons, cards, etc.)
   - Loading states and error handling

### Backend Modules
1. **API Endpoints**:
   - Gold price data retrieval
   - Historical data processing
   - Trading signal generation
   - News aggregation

2. **Data Integration**:
   - Multiple API source integration
   - Data normalization and processing
   - Caching mechanisms

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Fallback data generation
   - Error logging and monitoring
   - Graceful degradation

## Constraints
1. **Code Quality**:
   - Files limited to <500 lines for maintainability
   - Modular code with clear separation of concerns
   - Comprehensive error handling throughout

2. **Documentation**:
   - All endpoints documented
   - Component props documented
   - Setup instructions for local development

3. **Performance**:
   - Optimized bundle size
   - Efficient data fetching with caching
   - Responsive design for all device sizes

4. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for critical components
   - API integration tests
   - Fallback mechanism tests
